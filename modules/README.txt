# The Modules Folder of NET-UP - This Folder will read any bash/shell/
# python/perl/ruby/etc script. To initiate this loading process, make
# a default bash/shell script to load your desired files as a "module" 
# in NET-UP and Save the Script as a .mdu file. 
#
# This will get NET-UP to see the script as a "Module" for the Framework.

# Usage to easily Enable/Disable modules:
#
# Enable single Module.
# ./enablemod -f <module_name>
# Enable ALL Modules in Folder.
# ./enablemod -a
#
# Disable single Module.
# ./disablemod -f <module_name>
# Disable ALL Modules in Folder.
# ./disablemod -a

# Examples:
# ./disablemod -f subscan
# ./enablemod -f IPInfo
